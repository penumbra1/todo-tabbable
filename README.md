This is a simple todo app from a very useful [React course](https://egghead.io/courses/build-your-first-production-quality-react-app) by Andy van Slaars. I made a few tweaks:

- Experimented with [abortable fetch](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/abortable-fetch) for canceling async requests before unmounting
- Set up Jest to work with AbortController and fetch polyfills
- Used the new version of React Context API
- Made the app fully functional for keyboard-only users
- Cleaned up unnecessary divs, improved HTML semantics

Will add pretty styles if I feel like it:)
